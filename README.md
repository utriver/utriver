##👋 About Me
Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile.
I am an aspiring embedded & robotics engineer who enjoys building real-time control systems for robots and autonomous vehicles.

Currently working on robotics, autonomous driving, and embedded control projects.

Interested in autonomous driving, robotics, embedded systems, smart factories, and propulsion control.

My goal is to design reliable real-time software that runs safely on real robots and vehicles.

#🛠 Tech Stack
Languages
C/C++, Python, MATLAB (mainly used in projects)

C# (used for tools and side projects)

Robotics & Simulation
CoppeliaSim, Isaac Sim for robot and environment simulation

ROS2 and OpenCV for perception and robotics applications

You can find some of these in my repositories:

🔗 robotics-simulation-xyz – multi-robot navigation in CoppeliaSim

🔗 ros2-autonomous-car-xyz – ROS2-based autonomous driving prototype

(Replace xyz with your actual repo names and links.)

Control, Embedded & Industrial Communication
Model-Based Design with Simulink

Real-time operating environments such as Xenomai and EtherLAB

Industrial communication: EtherCAT, RS-485, CAN for motor and sensor control

Example repositories:

🔗 ethercat-motion-framework – C++ framework for multi-axis motor control over EtherCAT

🔗 rt-control-xenomai-demo – real-time control loop running on Xenomai

DevOps, Data & Tools
Git, GitHub for version control and collaboration

MongoDB, InfluxDB for logging and monitoring of robotics/industrial data

SolidWorks for mechanical design and robot structure review

Example repositories:

🔗 robot-logger-mongodb – logging sensor data into MongoDB

🔗 factory-monitor-influxdb – time-series monitoring with InfluxDB

🚀 Featured Projects
